Commercial Management Platform - Object Oriented Web Backend

This web backend project was inspired by commercial management systems, covering crucial resources such as categories, orders, payments, products and users. The project architecture is structured according to the following components:

Application <-> Resource Layer -> Service Layer -> Data Access Layer

Technologies Employed:

Spring Boot: Framework used for simplicity in development and configuration.

JPA/Hibernate: Object-relational mapping tools for manipulating data in the database.

H2 Database: Used as a temporary database for storing data during development.

Postman: Tool used to make requests and test the API efficiently.

The project adopts an object-oriented approach to ensure a robust and scalable structure, which I will later use as a template in other similar projects. Furthermore, it implements exception handling to deal with situations such as non-existent registration IDs, providing a more controlled and informative experience for the user.
